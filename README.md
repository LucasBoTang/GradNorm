# PyTorch GradNorm

<p align="center"><img width="90%" src="images/gradnorm.png" /></p>

This is a PyTorch-based implementation of [GradNorm: Gradient normalization for adaptive loss balancing in deep multitask networks](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/chen18a.html), which is a gradient normalization algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes.

The toy example can be found at [**here**](https://github.com/LucasBoTang/GradNorm/blob/main/Test.ipynb).

## Dependencies

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)


## Usage

### Parameters

- net: a multitask network with task loss
- layer: a layers of the network layers where appling GradNorm on the weights
- alpha: hyperparameter of restoring force
- dataloader: training dataloader
- num_epochs: number of epochs
- lr1:  learning rate of multitask loss
- lr2:  learning rate of weights
- log:  flag of result log

### Sample Code

```python
from gradnorm import gradNorm
log_weights, log_loss = gradNorm(net=mtlnet, layer=net.fc4, alpha=0.12, dataloader=dataloader,
                                 num_epochs=100, lr1=1e-5, lr2=1e-4, log=False)
```

## Toy Example (from Orignial Paper)

### Data

Consider *T* regression tasks trained using standard squared loss onto the functions:

<p align="center"><img width="25%" src="images/data.png" /></p>

Inputs are dimension 250 and outputs dimension 100, while B and ε_i are constant matrices with their elements generated IID from N(0; 10) and N(0; 3.5), respectively. Each task therefore shares information in B but also contains task-specific information ε_i. The σ_i sets the scales of the outputs.

```python
from data import toyDataset
dataset = toyDataset(num_data=10000, dim_features=250, dim_labels=100, scalars=[1,100])
```

### Model

A 4-layer fully-connected ReLU-activated network with 100 neurons per layer as a common trunk is used to train our toy example. A final affine transformation layer gives *T* final predictions.

```python
from model import fcNet, mtlNet
net = fcNet(dim_features=250, dim_labels=100, n_tasks=2) # fc net with multiple heads
mtlnet = mtlNet(net) # multitask net with task loss
```
